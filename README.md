This project is implementing 4 algorithms and testing them with the givenm examples in class.

Approximation Algorithm (Slide 11, Chapter 2.1).
The bisection Method (Slide 14, Chapter 2.1).
The fixed-point Iteration (Slide 13, Chapter 2.2)
The Newton-Raphson method (Slide 7, Chapter 2.3)
Algoirthm functions are in assignment_1 Testing functions are in test_assignment_1.py

Command run through terminal python3 src/test/test_assignment_1.py

Just in case there is issues the complete output is in output.txt
